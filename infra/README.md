# Welcome to your CDK C# project!

This is a blank project for CDK development with C#.

The `cdk.json` file tells the CDK Toolkit how to execute your app.

It uses the [.NET CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/articles/core/) to compile and execute your project.

## Useful commands

* `dotnet build src` 
  compile this app
* `cdk deploy`       
  deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
* `cdk diff`         
  compare deployed stack with current state
* `cdk synth`        
  emits the synthesized CloudFormation template
* `cdk synth > template.yaml`        
  emits the synthesized CloudFormation template to file
* `cdk bootstrap`   
  Initialize the environment (one time setup for each region, it will deploy a cloudformation to deploy necessary services like s3)
* `cdk init app --language csharp`        
  emits the synthesized CloudFormation template
